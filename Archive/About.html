<h1>Hello, My name is Cyndi</h1>
		
<p>About Me:
I have always enjoyed being in the kitchen cooking, baking, and trying out new recipes.
I usually follow the recipe as is the first time, then I tweak it to my liking and make it my own.
It started out as just a hobby to something I enjoy doing more and more.
When my kids were younger, I would buy their birthday cakes. As prices started going up, I thought that I could make these cakes myself. It took some trial and error but eventually I got the hang of it. My children and our guests all loved the cakes and baked goods that I produced. 
I started making cakes for co-workers for their birthdays and bringing in my new creations to get feedback on. That exposure led to my little side business as a baker. I started baking on the side for co-workers, family, and friends. Everyone tells me that I need to open a bakery; as much as I would love to have my own bakery, I never had the funds to do so. Creating a website for my baking business would also give me the opportunity to showcase my talent as a baker. </p>
